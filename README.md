# SCRIBBLER 
 Scribbler is a website created by me and my friends to find volunteered scribes for visually impaired students for their exams. 

 In 2015, there were an estimated 253 million people with visual impairment worldwide. Of these, 36 million were blind and a further 217 million had moderate to severe visual impairment (MSVI). It is estimated that at least 200,000 children in India have severe visual impairment or blindness and approximately 15,000 are in schools for the blind. Although this represents a small percentage of the estimated 5 million blind in India, it is significant in terms of 'blind-years.

 Without scribes to assist them, writing exams is a much more difficult task for visually challenged students, especially for those in rural pockets. Exams are stressful for everyone. For blind students, there is the added burden of looking for a scribe. A good scribe can make a significant difference to the future of a person. Itâ€™s a role that requires commitment, sincerity, and diligence. Any individual, including a housewife, professional, or student, who has finished their SSLC can come forward to offer their services as a scribe. Being a scribe can help these students to achieve their dreams.

 **Scribbler** is a platform for people to volunteer to be a scribe and help blind students in the communities. We connect the volunteered scribe with the visually impaired student such that they are from the same location or within the vicinity of the student who is in need of a scribe. We connect the scribe and the student via email so that they can communicate with each other and take up the exam successfully.
